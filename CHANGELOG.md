# Changelog

## 1.0.9

### Added
- Ollama model discovery with classification — `discover_models` MCP tool inventories local models by capability tier
- Paginated `get_directives` MCP tool with date filtering and text search
- PM timeout/retry parameters wired through `spawn_worker` pipeline (`pm_timeout`, `pm_max_retries`)
- Brain behavioral directive #19: never auto-switch workers to usage credits on rate limit
- Pin/decision-format enforcement for blocked-task escalations to operator
- Auto-unpin Brain escalation messages when tasks unblock
- Wiki page name validation — reject directive-number and date-stamped slugs
- Wiki server `/wiki` → `/wiki/` redirect for correct relative link resolution
- Security-guidance plugin integration for workers (Stage 1+3 active, Stage 2 disabled)
- `conftest.py` with `os.kill` guard for safe test isolation

### Fixed
- SessionStart hook race condition on Windows — pre-flight `COUNT(*)` check in `episodic-memory-sync.sh` exits cleanly when session row doesn't exist yet
- Heartbeat shows all alive workers using tmux as ground truth instead of DB status
- Immediate Brain notification on directive confirmation, removed 5-minute delay from reminders
- SQLite lock rollback in push sweep with confirmed-directive reminder
- Model config: switch opus defaults to short alias, remove `[1m]` suffix (Max plan auto-enables 1M context)

### Changed
- Default model updated to `claude-opus-4` (short alias) across worker commands
- Brain model uses `[1m]` suffix for explicit 1M context window opt-in

## 1.0.8

### Added
- Wiki knowledge layer implementing [Karpathy's LLM wiki pattern](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) — Brain-maintained markdown pages synthesized from episodic memory
- Wiki MCP tools: `wiki_write`, `wiki_delete`, `wiki_query`, `wiki_log`
- Dual-flag gate: gated actions now require both episodic memory search AND wiki query
- Brain rules for wiki workflows: post-directive ingest, periodic sweeps, search-triggered synthesis
- Wiki auto-commit: `wiki_write` and `wiki_delete` stage and commit after each mutation
- Wiki synthesis enforcer hook for Brain wiki compliance
- Task ledger persistence to `wiki/tasks.md` — survives daemon restarts
- `IC_ROLE` environment variable: workers get `IC_ROLE=worker` at spawn and bypass brain-orchestrator-guard restrictions
- Audit log entries for daemon-side professional mode deactivation writes

### Fixed
- Directive staleness prevention — mandatory status updates, text confirmation detection, sweep cross-referencing
- Pass missing `effort` argument to `make_opus_command()` calls — prevents TypeError when spawning opus workers
- Professional mode guard: allow `.claude/rules/` writes and `mkdir` during undecided state — unblocks first-time activation bootstrap
- Detect `AskUserQuestion` menus in `send_to_worker` — navigate to free-text option instead of accidentally selecting default menu item
- Background job detection in get-back-to-work hook to reduce false positives
- Notification heartbeat messages now show actual task description instead of repeated preamble text

### Changed
- Default model switched to `opus` (short alias) for 1M context window
- Restored illustrative override examples in README model config section
- Removed internal workflow artifacts (docs/) from repository tracking
